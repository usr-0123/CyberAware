  // Creating a comprehensive cybersecurity threat assessment questionnaire is a great way to gather insights! Here are some useful questions you could include to cover different threat areas:

  "Awareness and Knowledge": [
    "How would you rate your knowledge of common cybersecurity threats (e.g., phishing, ransomware, malware)?",
    "How often do you actively seek information about new cybersecurity threats?",
  ],

  "Device Security": [
    "Do you use antivirus or anti-malware software on your devices? If yes, how often is it updated?",
    "How often do you update the software and operating systems on your devices?",
    "Do you use secure passwords and two-factor authentication for your accounts?",
  ],

  "Network Security": [
    "Do you use public Wi-Fi networks frequently? If yes, what security measures do you take?",
    "Are you aware of the risks associated with using unsecured or public Wi-Fi networks?",
  ],

  "Phishing and Social Engineering": [
    "Have you ever received a suspicious email or message asking for personal information? How did you respond?",
    "Are you familiar with techniques to identify phishing emails or social engineering attempts?",
  ],
  "Data Protection and Privacy": [
    "How do you protect sensitive personal or work-related information on your devices?",
    "Are you cautious about sharing personal information on social media or online platforms?",
  ],
  "Behavioral Patterns": [
    "How often do you download files or software from unknown sources?",
    "Do you use the same password for multiple accounts?",
    "Have you ever encountered a potential data breach or unauthorized access to one of your accounts?",
  ],
  "Incident Handling": [
    "If you suspect a cybersecurity incident, what steps do you take immediately?",
    "Have you experienced any cybersecurity incidents in the past year? If so, please describe the incident and its impact.",
  ],
  "General Concerns and Precautions": [
    "What types of cybersecurity threats are you most concerned about?",
    "What are some precautions you take to secure your online presence?",
  ],
  // These questions should help you gather meaningful insights on awareness levels, behaviors, and areas where people may be at risk. Let me know if youâ€™d like further assistance with specific threat categories!
